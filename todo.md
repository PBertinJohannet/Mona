## before going anywhere
# complete tests.
 make a non-working example for each test in ArgCount.
# add signature checking to tests.
 and use '>' instead of >>>
# test different permutations of the tests.
# clean all TODOs
# keep an explanation of the algorithm for reconciliation + types/function used.
then you can continue what you want.
